This guide is based on the official Frappe documentation. You can find the original documentation at:

## <b>Frappe Documentations</b>

This is the documentation for Frappe, a full-stack web framework that includes a database, ORM,
templating engine, and a web framework.

Setup Frappe on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
---------------------------------------

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Frappe on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS :


* <b><u>`Update and Upgrade Packages `</u></b>

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    ```
* <b><u>`Create a new user - (bench user)`</u></b>
    
    In linux, the root user processes escalated privileges to perform any tasks within the system. This is why it is not advisable to use this user on a daily basis. We will create a user that we can use, and this will be the user we will also use as the Frappe Bench User.

    ```bash
    sudo adduser [frappe-user]
    usermod -aG sudo [frappe-user]
    su [frappe-user] 
    cd /home/[frappe-user]
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    ```

## Install Required Packages
To install softwares required for the creation of Frappe Bench : 
* <b><u>`Install GIT`</u></b>

    ```
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```
* <b><u> `Install Python` </u></b>
    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3.10-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-distutils
    ```
* <b><u> `Install Python Virtual Environment` </u></b>
    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3.10-venv
    ```
* <b><u> `Install Software Properties common` </u></b>
    ```
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    ```
* <b><u> `Install MariaDB` </u></b>

    ERPNext is built to naively run on MariaDB. The team is working to have the same working on PostgreSQL, but this is not ready yet.
    ```
    sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client
    ```
* <b><u> `Install Redis Server` </u></b>
    ```
    sudo apt-get install redis-server
    ```
* <b><u> `Install Other Packages` </u></b>
    ```
    sudo apt-get install xvfb libfontconfig wkhtmltopdf
    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
    ```

### Configure MYSQL Server
    ```
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```
When you run this command, the server will show the following prompts. Please follow the steps as shown below to complete the setup correctly.

```
    1. Enter current password for root: (Enter your SSH root user password)

    2. Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]: Y

    3. Change the root password? [Y/n]: Y

    4. It will ask you to set new MySQL root password at this step. This can be different from the SSH root user password.

    5. Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y

    6. Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: N
    This is set as N because we might want to access the database from a remote server for using business analytics software like Metabase / PowerBI / Tableau, etc.

    7. Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]: Y

    8. Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]: Y
```

### Edit MySQL default config file
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
   ```
Add the following block of code exactly as is:

```
[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8mb4
```

Restart the MySQL Server
    ```
    sudo service mysql restart
    ```

### Install CURL, Node, NPM and Yarn

    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
    source ~/.profile
    nvm install 18
    sudo apt-get install npm
    sudo npm install -g yarn
    ```
If you followed all the steps rightly, Kudos, your system meets all the required dependencies! Hooray!


### Install Frappe Bench
    sudo pip3 install frappe-bench 
    

### Initialize Frappe Bench
    bench init --frappe-branch version-15 frappe-bench

### Switch directories into the Frappe Bench directory
    cd frappe-bench

### Change user directory permissions
    ```
    This will give the bench user execution permission to the home directory.
    
    chmod -R o+rx /home/[frappe-user]
    ```
### Create a New Site
A site is a requirement in ERPNext, Frappe and all the other apps we will be needing to install. We will create the site in this step.

    bench new-site [site-name]
### Install ERPNext and other Apps
Download all the apps we want to install
The first app we will download is the payments app. This app is required when setting up ERPNext.

    bench get-app payments
    bench get-app --branch version-15 erpnext
Download any other app you may be interested in in a similar manner. For instance, if you need the Human Resource app to be installed, use the following command.

    bench get-app hrms
Install all the apps on our site
    bench --site [site-name] install-app erpnext
Install all the other apps you downloaded in the same way. 

We have successfully setup ERPNext version 15 on ubuntu 22.04. You can start the server by running the below command:

    bench start
If you didnâ€™t have any other ERPNext instance running on the same server, ERPNext will get started on port 8000. If you visit [YOUR SERVER IP:8000], you should be able to see ERPNext version 15 running.

Please note that instances which are running on develop mode, like the one we just setup, will not get started when you restart your server. You will need to run the bench start command every time the server restarts.

In the below steps, we will learn how to deploy the production mpde.

## Setting ERPNext for Production
### Enable Scheduler
    bench --site [site-name] enable-scheduler
### Disable maintenance mode
    bench --site [site-name] set-maintenance-mode off
### Setup production config
    sudo bench setup production [frappe-user]
### Setup NGINX to apply the changes
    bench setup nginx
### Restart Supervisor and Launch Production Mode
    sudo supervisorctl restart all
    sudo bench setup production [frappe-user]

If you are prompted to save the new/existing config file, respond with a Y.
